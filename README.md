# Waste Detection using YOLO (Computer Vision Project)

Object detection system developed as part of an academic robotics project focused on automated waste recognition.

This repository contains the model training pipeline and the inference module used to evaluate detection performance.

---

## Features

* YOLO-based object detection training
* GPU training using Google Colab
* Image / video inference testing
* Bounding box visualization
* Model export after training

---

## Technologies

* Python
* Ultralytics YOLO
* PyTorch
* OpenCV
* Google Colab

---

## Project Structure

* `train.py` → Script used to train the object detection model
* `test_reconocimiento.py` → Script used to test detection performance
* `requirements.txt` → Required Python libraries

---

## My Contribution

This was a collaborative academic project.

My responsibilities included:

* Configuring the training environment
* Running model training experiments
* Implementing the detection testing script
* Evaluating detection performance

---

## Notes

Training was performed using a cloud GPU environment via Google Colab.

Large datasets and trained weights are NOT included in this repository.

## How to Run

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run detection test:

```
python test_reconocimiento.py
```
